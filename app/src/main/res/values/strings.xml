    <string name="workout_dialog_info_tip">Hey! Just some quick tips. So, you will get info like this when you start workout. What this means is, you will be doing workout for <b>45 seconds, with 15 seconds rest.</b> Try to repeat this workout at least <b>3 times.</b> If you feel like you can\'t keep on going, try not to stop, just decrease your pace to as low as possible. We\'re in this together, now I wont bother you anymore, good luck and enjoy the process!</string>
